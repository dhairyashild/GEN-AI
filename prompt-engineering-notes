What is Prompt Engineering?
-------Skill to communicate with AI models to get desired o/p


Zero-Shot Prompting
No examples given, direct request
Example: "Explain machine learning in simple terms"

Few-Shot Prompting
Provide examples for pattern learning
Example: "Cat→Meow, Dog→Bark, Cow→Moo, Lion→"

Chain-of-Thought=reasoning
Ask for step-by-step reasoning
Example: "If 2x=10, find x. Show your work."

Persona Prompting
Assign specific expert role
Example: "Act as a senior software engineer"

Format Specification
Define exact output structure
Example: "Provide answer as bullet points"

----------------------------------------------

TCRIE + COF

T = Task (Goal)
C = Context (Background)
R = Role (Persona)
I = Instructions (Constraints)
E = Examples (Patterns)
COF (Always add):
C = Chain-of-thought (Reasoning)
O = Output format (Structure)
F = Feedback loop (Iterate)
----------------------------------------------

--------------------- USE RTICE METHOD INNSTAED OF TCREI LIKE BELOW -------------------------
Sequence flexible - logic matters more
Better order: RTICE  + CO
Role first (sets expertise)
Task second (defines goal)
Instructions third (constraints)
Context fourth (background)
Examples last (pattern)
Chain-of-thought: [Show reasoning]
Output: [Specific format]

Most important: Role + Task together start
